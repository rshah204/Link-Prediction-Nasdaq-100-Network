Network Analysis: Link Prediction Nasdaq 100 Network
----------------

Inferring the Nasdaq 100 Network of Correlated Social Media Chatter.

Some firms may have closely related patterns in the amount of social media chatter about them over time. In this project, an undirected networks that link firms based upon the (partial) correlations in their Twitter activity is built and described. In this network, two firms are linked if there is a statistically significant correlation in the daily number of Twitter messages that mention them. 

The attached dataset shows the number of Twitter messages—collected each day during financial trading hours—that mention each of the Nasdaq 100 firms. The daily variation in activity and their correlations over time might suggest how temporal patterns of sentiment about firms may be connected with one another.
